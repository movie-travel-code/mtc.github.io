### About Me

I am a Code Safe Engineer at `360 Enterprise Security Group`. My main interest are as follows:

 - Static Program Analysis
 - Compiler
 - C/C++
 - Or any technical towards to improve the program

However I am still a newbee about program analysis :).
### Skills
#### Static Program Analysis
I am familiar with [Clang Static Analyzer][1], I have 21 patchs accepted by the LLVM community so far. This is my patch list, [MTC (Henry Wong)][2].

I have solid knowledge about dataflow analysis and familiar with symbolic execution. I know pointer analysis and type analysis, nevertheless I am not good it.

With regard to static analysis, I have too much to learn.

#### Compiler
I am familiar with compiler frontend and know about compiler backend. I have a homework compiler moese, it is based on swift and LLVM IR. So far, it has only been generated to SSA form and has no optimization.

With regard to compiler, I have too much to learn too.

#### Programming Language
I am familiar with C/C++ and know python.

#### English
I have passed CET-4 and CET-6. However I am not so good at English writing and English speaking. As you can see, this page is written by immature Englishã€‚

### Education

[`University of Electronic Science and Technology`][3] *Master of Computer Software and Theory* 2014.09 - 2017.06

[`University of Electronic Science and Technology`][3] *Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology* 2010.09 - 2014.06

### Hobby
I love travelling and had two long journeys.

 - I once cycled along [China National Highway 318][4] from ChendDu to Lhasa in 2012.07
 - I once tried to travel on [Trans-Siberian Railway][5], but for various reasons, my trip stopped at Lake Baikal. Yea, this is a pity in my life.
